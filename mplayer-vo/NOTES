Notes:
  needs to do direct rendering, but you don't have
  to specify -dr on the command line because vo will
  enable it automatically if it can

  needs to double buffer, but you don't have to specify that either (-double)

  doesn't do windows - takes over framebuffer for now

  h264 issues:
        currently not working
        video currently doesn't direct render unless u post process with -vf pp
        broken on PS3 (regardless of vo) - too slow & audio strange
        try with -demuxer 35 -lavdopts fast:threads=2 for improvement, but still not usable
        try with -vo null and still broken (see, it's not vo's fault :) )

  configure now autodetects ps3

  works with:
     'f'      for fullscreen scaling toggle
     'space'  for pausing
     '.       for single frame stepping

  use -vo ps3:snapshot to save a .yuv file of current buffers on pause
