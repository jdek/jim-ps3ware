/* vo_ps3.c - video out interface utilizing spu-medialib
 *            to offload scaling and yuv2rgb colorspace
 *            conversion to the PS3's SPEs:
 *    http://wiki.ps2dev.org/ps3:spu-medialib
 *
 * This is very experimental code which is not ready for
 * public consumption.  Many todo:'s remain, and
 * many more mistakes still need to be corrected.
 *
 * Distributed AS IS.  Use at your own risk.  Author is not liable
 * in any way for any use, misuse, nonuse, expectation, failed
 * expectation, problem, or anything else.
 *
 * Notes:
 *    needs to do direct rendering but enables it automatically
 *    don't need -dr flag
 *
 *    needs to double buffer - also automatic (no -double needed)
 *
 *    doesn't do windows - takes over framebuffer for now
 *
 *    h264 issues:
 *       video currently doesn't "direct render" unless u post process
 *       with -vf pp or something
 *       broken on PS3 (regardless of vo) - too slow & audio strange
 *       using -demuxer 35 -lavdopts fast:threads=2 will provide
 *       improvement once ffmpeg uses threads for x264.  Now it's too slow
 *       try with -vo null and still broken (see, it's not vo's fault :) )
 *
 *    configure now autodetects spu-medialib and enables vo_ps3
 *
 *    use -vo ps3:snapshot to save current buffers in a .yuv file on pause
 *
 * Installation:
 *    install ps3fb (http://forums.ps2dev.org/viewtopic.php?p=59150#59150)
 *    install spu-medialib (http://forums.ps2dev.org/viewtopic.php?t=9109)
