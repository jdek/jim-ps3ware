Ps3MediaPlayer
--------------

This project aims to do a very slim native mediaplayer running as an "OtherOS" on Playstation(r) 3
It will be based on the ffmpeg project and thus be under the GPL license due to various parts of ffmpeg
is under that license. 

I currently with this project has no intention of making it a fullblown mediacenter app. It will only
feature a limited gui and stream data over network as thats what I mostly want and what I think many
people wants as well. A simple player that starts very fast and lets you stream mkv/xvid/etc over network.
